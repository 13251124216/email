Robust and flexible email library for Go

### Email for humans
The ```email``` package is designed to be simple to use, but flexible enough so as not to be restrictive. The goal is to provide an *email interface for humans*.

Plans for the ```email``` package currently include supporting:
*  From, To, Bcc, Cc fields
*  Email addresses in both "test@example.com" and "First Last <test@example.com>" format
*  Text and Html Message Body
*  Attachments
*  Custom headers
*  More to come!

### Installation
```go get github.com/jordan-wright/email```

*Note: Requires go version 1.1 and above*

### Examples
*Coming Soon*
